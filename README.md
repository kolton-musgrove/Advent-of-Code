[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly puzzling competition put on by [@topaz](https://github.com/topaz). The event consists of 50-puzzles that range in difficulty and are solved using programming! The problems are similar to programming interview questions, but they are often framed in very novel ways and they follow a storyline! There are two puzzles released each day at midnight EST. For each puzzle you solve, you recieve one gold star.

This event is a ton of fun each year and a great way for the programming community to work together, have fun, and learn some new things about programming.

This year the storyline has consisted so far of taking a vacation from saving Christmas, which has been the theme for the past few years, and going on a vacation.

## Days

1. [Day one](https://github.com/kolton-musgrove/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/day%201) focused on finding numbers in an array that sum to a specific number, in our case 2020!
2. [Day two](https://github.com/kolton-musgrove/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/day%202) was about string parsing to enforce basic password security.
3. [Day three](https://github.com/kolton-musgrove/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/day%203) focused on patterned-string parsing to find a safe travel route of tobaggans.
4. [Day four](https://github.com/kolton-musgrove/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/day%204) was about passport validation and hashmaps!
5. [Day five](https://github.com/kolton-musgrove/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/day%205) used principles of binary search to find seats on a plane.
6. [Day six](https://github.com/kolton-musgrove/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/day%206) focused on group qualifications and binary representations.
